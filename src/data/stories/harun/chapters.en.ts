        text: 'When Musa was given the tremendous task of confronting Pharaoh, he turned to Allah with a heartfelt supplication. He asked Allah to appoint a minister from his family — his brother Harun — to increase his strength and share in his mission. Musa prayed: "And appoint for me a minister from my family — Aaron, my brother. Increase through him my strength and let him share my task, that we may exalt You much and remember You much. Indeed, You are of us ever Seeing." Allah responded with complete acceptance: "You have been granted your request, O Musa." This exchange reveals the deep bond between the two brothers and the importance of having righteous companions in the path of calling people to Allah.',

Musa acknowledged that his brother was more fluent, saying: "And my brother Aaron is more fluent than me in tongue, so send him with me as support, verifying me. Indeed, I fear that they will deny me." Together, they were commissioned by Allah to go to Pharaoh and speak to him with gentle words, in the hope that he might take heed or fear Allah. This divine instruction to use soft speech even with the most tyrannical ruler illustrates the prophetic methodology of calling people to the truth with wisdom.',

He collected golden ornaments from the people and fashioned them into the shape of a calf that produced a lowing sound. As-Samiri told the people: "This is your god and the god of Musa, but he forgot." Harun, who had been left in charge, saw what was happening and tried his utmost to dissuade them. He warned them: "O my people, you are only being tested by it, and indeed, your Lord is the Most Merciful, so follow me and obey my order." But the people refused and said they would not stop worshipping the calf until Musa returned. Harun was overpowered and nearly killed by them.',
