    title: 'How Allah Created Adam',
    content: 'Allah, our Creator, decided to create the very first human being. He took clay from the earth and shaped it into a beautiful form. Then Allah breathed life into it, and Adam became alive! Allah taught Adam the names of everything — animals, plants, mountains, and rivers. The angels were amazed because Adam knew things they did not know!',

    title: 'The Angels and Iblis',
    content: 'Allah asked all the angels to bow down to Adam to show respect. All the angels obeyed right away because they always listen to Allah. But Iblis (Shaytan) was there too, and he refused! He was too proud. He said, "I am better than him because I am made of fire and he is made of clay." Allah was very displeased with Iblis and told him to leave Paradise.',

    title: 'The Beautiful Garden',
    content: 'Allah placed Adam and his wife Hawwa (Eve) in a wonderful garden in Paradise. They could eat any fruit they wanted and go anywhere they liked. There was only one rule — they must not eat from one special tree. Allah told them to stay away from it. Everything was perfect and they were very happy!',

    title: 'The Mistake and Saying Sorry',
    content: 'Iblis was jealous and wanted to trick Adam and Hawwa. He kept whispering to them, "If you eat from that tree, you will live forever!" He tricked them until they ate from the forbidden tree. As soon as they did, they felt ashamed. But they did not blame anyone else — they turned to Allah right away and said, "Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we will surely be among the losers." Allah forgave them because they were truly sorry! This teaches us that when we make a mistake, we should always ask Allah for forgiveness.',

    title: 'Life on Earth',
    content: 'Allah sent Adam and Hawwa to live on Earth. He told them not to worry — He would always guide them and their children. Allah promised that He would send messengers to teach people the right way to live. Adam was the very first prophet! He taught his children to worship only Allah and to be kind and good. And that is how the story of all humans began!',
