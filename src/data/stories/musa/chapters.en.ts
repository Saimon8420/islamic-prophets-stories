In the midst of this terror, Allah sent a divine inspiration to the mother of Musa, telling her to nurse her baby and, when she feared for his safety, to place him in a chest and cast it into the river. She was told not to fear and not to grieve, for Allah promised to return him to her and to make him one of the messengers.
